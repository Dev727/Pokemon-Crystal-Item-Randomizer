Name: Standard Logic with Randomized TMs with No Level Scaling
Description: These settings are identical to standard, but they also allow for the universal pokemon randomizer's ability to randomize TM moves. To allow this, all item locations which require rock smash are ignored by the randomizer, as the rock smash TM is one of the TMs which has its move randomized.
