Name: Johto Mode
Description: The item randomizer is restricted to randomizing items which appear in johto. These settings also allow for the universal pokemon randomizer's ability to randomize TM moves. To allow this, all item locations which require rock smash are ignored by the randomizer, as the rock smash TM is one of the TMs which has its move randomized.
